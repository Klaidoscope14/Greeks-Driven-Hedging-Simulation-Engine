# Options Market Maker Simulation 

A comprehensive, professional-grade simulation framework for option pricing, market making, delta hedging, and execution modelling. 

---

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a full pipeline of an options market‑maker:

* Pricing options using **Binomial Trees** and **Black‑Scholes**.
* Computing **Greeks** analytically and numerically.
* Automating **delta hedging** using configurable hedging strategies.
* Simulating **underlying price paths** using Geometric Brownian Motion.
* Modelling **transaction costs**, order execution, and inventory changes.
* Running full simulations and exporting **CSV results** for analysis.

It is structured using modern, modular **C++20**, with a clean architecture, strong encapsulation, and full unit test coverage via GoogleTest.

## 🧮 Option Pricing Models

### **Binomial Tree Pricing**

Implements a step‑based tree (CRR model):

* Up/down factors from volatility
* Risk‑neutral probability
* Backward induction for European options

Useful for validating Greeks, exploring convergence, and demonstrating numerical understanding.

### **Black‑Scholes Analytical Model**

Closed‑form pricing for European calls and puts:

* Fast
* Stable
* Provides analytical Greeks for comparison and model validation

---

## 📈 Greeks Calculation

The framework computes Greeks in two ways:

### **1. Analytical Greeks (Black‑Scholes)**

* Delta
* Gamma
* Vega
* Theta
* Rho

### **2. Numerical Greeks**

Using finite‑difference approximations:

* Delta ≈ (P(S+h) – P(S−h)) / (2h)
* Gamma ≈ (P(S+h) − 2P(S) + P(S−h)) / h²
* Vega via perturbation of volatility

These are essential for hedging validation and model sanity‑checks.

---

## 🔄 Hedging Engine

The market maker uses:

### **Delta Hedger**

Computes hedge quantity:

```
target_position = - delta × notional
```

Keeps the portfolio approximately delta‑neutral.

### **Hedging Strategies**

Two included examples:

* **Threshold Hedging** → trade only when mismatch exceeds a threshold
* **Perfect Delta Match** → immediate hedge to target

This structure is extensible for gamma‑hedging, vega‑hedging, etc.

---

## 💹 Execution Engine

Simulates realistic order execution:

* Buy/Sell orders
* Transaction cost model:

```
cost = fixed_fee + pct_fee × notional
```

* Updates cash, inventory, and PnL

This helps quantify hedging performance under market frictions.

---

## 📊 Market Simulation

Underlying asset follows **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**:

```
dS = μSdt + σS dW
```

Generates a price path used to:

* Recompute Greeks each timestep
* Trigger hedging actions
* Compute PnL (realized + mark‑to‑market)

---

## 🧪 Unit Testing

GoogleTest covers:

* Binomial Tree convergence
* Greeks correctness
* Execution engine logic
* Hedging strategy behavior
* Simulation output sanity checks

Ensures correctness and reliability.

---

## 📂 Simulation Output

Simulation generates a CSV in `results/` containing:

```
step, spot, option_price, delta, position, cash, pnl, hedge_order_qty, hedge_order_side
```

This file can be explored using the included Jupyter notebook.

---

## 📊 Jupyter Notebook Analysis

`analyze_results.ipynb` generates:

* PnL curves
* Hedge mismatch over time
* Delta trajectories
* Price vs hedge actions
* Greeks evolution

Excellent for showcasing quant intuition during interviews.
